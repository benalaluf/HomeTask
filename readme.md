# Telegram Bot Testing Project

This project automates the testing of a Telegram bot designed to calculate the hash of `.jpg` and `.jpeg` images. If the bot encounters other file types or text, it will return an error. Testing is seamlessly executed through the Telegram interface using a Python script with Appium.

## Requirements

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- **ADB Environment**: Ensure that `adb` (Android Debug Bridge) is installed and correctly configured on your machine.
- **Telegram**: The Android device must have Telegram installed and logged into the test account.
- **Image Files**: Ensure that your test images (`.jpg`/`.jpeg`) are pushed to the device before starting the tests.

## Setup

1. Connect your Android device via `adb` and ensure Telegram is logged in.
2. Push the test images to the connected device using the following script:
    ```bash
    ./push_images.sh
    ```

## Running the Project

You’ve got two ways to run the tests:

### 1. Running with `tmux_run.sh` (The Cool Way 😎)

This is the recommended option for those who enjoy seeing things happen in real-time. Using `tmux`, this script splits your terminal into multiple panes, letting you observe device logs and test results side by side.

- **Requirements**: 
  - You need `tmux` installed to enjoy this cool feature.

- **How to Run**:
    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x tmux_run.sh
    sudo ./tmux_run.sh
    ```

This will automatically pick the live `adb` device, fire up `tmux`, and start the tests in an awesome split-screen view!

### 2. Running with `run.sh` (The Simple Way)

If you’re looking for a no-fuss, straightforward execution, you can run the tests with `run.sh`. No `tmux` required, just plain output.

- **How to Run**:
    ```bash
    ./run.sh
    ```

The test will run as usual, printing everything to your terminal.

## Automatic ADB Device Selection

Both `run.sh` and `tmux_run.sh` scripts are smart enough to automatically detect and connect to the live `adb` device on your network. No need to manually specify devices—just sit back and let the scripts handle it!

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that your Android Virtual Device (AVD) or physical device is properly connected and recognized by `adb`.
- The project is designed to be user-friendly and straightforward, with a lot of work spent learning Docker to streamline the process for you. 🐳

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues, manually running the Docker container is recommended. It may give you more control over debugging any environment problems that pop up.

Enjoy testing in style! 🎉
